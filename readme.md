To install a Python library, you can use the `pip` package manager. Here are the general steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your Python project is located.
3. Run the following command to install the library:

    ```
    pip install library_name
    ```

    Replace `library_name` with the actual name of the library you want to install.

4. Wait for the installation to complete. Once it's done, you can start using the library in your Python code.

Remember to activate your virtual environment if you're using one before installing the library. If you don't have `pip` installed, you can follow the official Python documentation to install it.
